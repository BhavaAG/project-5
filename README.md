1.define a function name binary and give the number
2.if number is greater than or equal to 1, call the recursive function for the floor division
3.print number%2 and call the function

solution 2(decimal to octal):
1.define a function name octal and give the input in argument
2.use a method called oct()
3.call the function

solution 3(decimal to hexa):
1.define a function name hexadecimal and give the input
2.use a method "{0:x}".format(input number) and store it to the variable
